# Westie

#### WHY?

This was a small group project with the aim of:

###### 1) build an app using the Express framework.
###### 2) Use a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data.
###### 3) Use the retrieved data to populate a Handlebars template for server-side rendering to be displayed on the front-end.

##### WHAT?
A simple table format website that displays giphy images, based on stored text urls in a database. The explicit goal here was to use partials to display our page. 

#### HOW? 
Using a test based approach we built a web application that was build using Express and accessed its data stored in a pSQL database. The data stored in our database were links to giphy and would render in a table format in the front end. We would use security protocols as a stretch goal if we had time to further our knowledge from previous weeks.
